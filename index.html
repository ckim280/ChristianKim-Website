        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Christian Kim. I am a Korean American and I was born in California. Considering my name, Christian, I am a Christian and believe in Jesus Christ. I attend church weekly in Irvine and I enjoy going to summer and winter retreats to get my spiritual high and learn more about God. In retreat, I am able to have fellowship with my peers and I get to fully surrender myself to understand God and give up my distractions to only focus on him. I love to hang out with my friends and especially play sports with them because I have a lot of competitive fire and energy to continuously put in my efforts for sports. My favorite sport is basketball because I have played basketball since I was 4th grade. In junior high school, I didnâ€™t make the basketball team so my dreams were destroyed, however, my family told me to not give up and try out for the high school team. I tried out and I made the team and became a varsity basketball player during my junior year of high school, so without my parents I would have given up basketball forever. My favorite animal is a cheetah because of the similarities that I share with this particular animal. The biggest similarity I have with a cheetah is that I am able to sprint very quickly for a short distance but I get tired quickly as well. For a cheetah, they also are able to sprint at high speeds for a short amount of time but then they must rest because they get fatigued very fast too. My favorite color is blue because of the serenity and tranquility that the color gives off. Additionally, the color blue is usually represented with the ocean and the sky which is considered beautiful nature and calmness throughout the world. I love looking out into the ocean to enjoy the horizon and sun glistening off the waters, and I love to look up into the sky to see the clouds covering part of the sun. My favorite food is beef brisket in Korean BBQ because it is very cheap, fast to cook, and delicious. I enjoy eating Korean BBQ with my friends and so I am very impatient since I want to continuously eat meat with no rest. Whenever I take too long to eat the meat on the grill, my stomach then starts to realize that I am actually full so I canâ€™t eat as much as I want to. The beef brisket is very thin as well so there is not a lot of chewing involved and therefore, I would not get tired and stop eating food. My favorite Korean food is pork back-bone stew because the soup and meat within the dish is very delicious and juicy. When eating this particular cuisine in the restaurant, I order additional meat because they donâ€™t usually give enough for my stomach to suffice so I must order more for me to successfully fill myself up.

        Throughout my high school life, I only had two real work experiences while having some other volunteer work. One of the volunteer work that I had was training little kids in coaching for a Filipino organization, KABA. I volunteered once every week for about two hours at a gym in Garden Grove. The KABA organization rented out courts at this gym so that we can use multiple courts to train all the kids who paid for the clinic. During this clinic, there are many coaches that are present to help out with the training and they each choose a specific skill that they can help the kids excel in. There were many specific skills to teach to the beginners of basketball such as dribbling, shooting, passing, defense, and conditioning. Since I was a point guard in my high school basketball career, I was usually placed with dribbling and shooting to teach the kids. Another volunteer experience that I had during the summer was being on the retreat committee for my church. With this volunteering opportunity, I had to set up and organize the summer retreat with a group of other high school volunteers such as the financial, transportation, creative, and entertainment aspect of the retreat. The administration and transportation sector had to collect all of the forms from the students and the money that is required to attend the retreat and then with these forms, we split the students into groups for the week of retreat. Also, we had to figure out the bus rides to and from the retreat site. For the creative and entertainment portion of the retreat consisted of creating games to play for the retreat and creating the posters for the groups as a whole. I had two real work experiences, however, one of the work experiences was the same as my first volunteering experience. My first job was teaching little kids how to play basketball in private training so that I can focus on a lesser number of kids and train them more efficiently. During the volunteer segment of basketball, there were too many kids for me to focus on the minor details, but with the private training, I was able to analyze everything the kids did wrong and right. My final work experience would be tutoring kids in math at Mathnasium in Cypress, California. In this workplace, I spent a lot of time grading and helping the students with their homework and additional work for the academy. When the students are struggling with their academics, I must demonstrate the MATHNASIUM way to solve the problem which would allow the students to grow intellectually and mentally. With this experience, I learned how to maintain and handle students when they canâ€™t focus on their assignments and workload and place them back on track so that they can complete everything that they need to do. I liked my work experience at Mathnasium because I was able to teach the students math, my favorite subject, while getting paid which was very easy money on my part.

        I wasnâ€™t really sure what I wanted to be in the future because of my many interests and desires throughout my life. During my childhood, my wildest dream was to become a National Basketball Association player since I always dreamed of playing my favorite sport and earning millions of dollars for it. I wanted to be the star point guard of the Los Angeles Lakers and play along with other NBA hall of famers so that my fame can soar through the roof. However, before my dream can grow into something huge, my dad shut down my dreams in a matter of seconds. He claimed that I would not be able to make it into the NBA because I was a short Korean who doesnâ€™t have the most amazing potential in this world. I was heartbroken to hear this statement from my own father but with this I was able to pursue a more realistic goal of being a Certified Public Accountant. The person to push me towards this decision was my mother because she herself is a Certified Public Accountant and she considered my strengths. Throughout my life, I have been known as an extrovert who goes around reaching out to other people and socializing with anyone I please. Additionally, I have been known to be good at math as well because I have gotten Aâ€™s in every single one of my math classes and got a five on my AP Calculus BC exam which was a pretty difficult test. With this in mind, my mom told me to become a Certified Public Accountant because I would be able to utilize all of these skills and these particular set of skills will help me become successful. For this job, I would need to go around and socialize with many other clients in order to form a business relationship and maybe even form a close relationship to secure the connection. Gathering clients and creating more clientele for my company is an essential part of my job as well and so my social skills and energy would help me in that department especially. Accounting also has to do with lots of numbers whether it is addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division and my love of math would help me tremendously. I didnâ€™t really enjoy calculus and pre-calculus but I loved algebra since the basic operations are not complicated and complex. Rather than dealing with multiple steps and ways to come across the same answer, I would much rather deal with one simple way and get one solid answer. Ever since I was a kid, I was really fast and accurate in doing these math tests and quizzes so therefore, I knew that even when I grow up, I would enjoy this type of math. Although I have decided to pursue my career as a Certified Public Accountant, I donâ€™t know what my life will be like in the future and so it may change or it may stay the same. I need to keep my eyes and mind open for other opportunities and let my future be determined by myself.
